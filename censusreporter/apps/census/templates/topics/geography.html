<p>
    Despite the centrality of geography to Census data, many key concepts are not centrally defined. Instead, each data release documents the subsets of geographic metadata that are relevant to that release. Fortunately, the metadata is consistent from release to release—it's just sometimes hard to find a single source that lays out all of the details.
</p>
<h2>Summary Levels</h2>
<p>
    All data in the American Community Survey is aggregated to a specific summary level. Summary levels are classes of geographies, or shapes on a map. All of the geographies in a summary level are independent—they never overlap each other. But sometimes they don't fall neatly inside larger summary levels.
</p>
<p>
    These are the fundamental summary levels of the Census:
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>010</dt>
        <dd>The United States</dd>
        <dt>040</dt>
        <dd>States</dd>
        <dt>050</dt>
        <dd>Counties</dd>
        <dt>140</dt>
        <dd>Census Tracts</dd>
    </dl>
</p>
<p>
    For each of these, the next level down is a perfect subdivision&mdash;that is, all of the "parent" geography is covered by the "children." As always, there are subtle exceptions: Puerto Rico is a <strong>040</strong> summary level, but it is not technically part of the <strong>010</strong> (United States). And, while Washington, DC is not a state, it is counted in <strong>040</strong>, and it is part of <strong>010</strong>. And while there is no true county government for DC, there is a record for it in the <strong>050</strong> summary level, to maintain this consistency.

</p>
<h3>Places</h3>
<p>
    Reporters will often want numbers for the cities and towns in their coverage area. This can be more complicated than you might first believe.
</p>
<p>
    Incorporated cities, towns, and villages are part of the  <strong>160</strong> summary level, generically described as <strong>places</strong> The <strong>160</strong> level also includes "Census designated places," or CDPs, which provide data for unincorporated areas which are commonly recognized by people who live in or near them. Place boundaries can divide census tracts and cross county borders, but a place is always contained in a single state.

    There is no clearly designated "official" list of Census summary levels, but there is <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/help/en/glossary/s/summary_level_code_list.htm">in the American FactFinder help documentation. The Missouri Census Data Center created <a href="http://mcdc2.missouri.edu/cgi-bin/browse?/pub/sasfmats/Ssumlev.sas@">a list designed for use with SAS statistical software</a>. (Even if you don't use SAS, it's easy to read and may come in handy sometimes.) It's part of their own <a href="http://mcdc.missouri.edu/allabout/sumlevs/">extensive documentation about Census summary levels</a>.
