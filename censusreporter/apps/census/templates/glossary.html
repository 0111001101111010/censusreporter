            <p>Here are a few key official Census sources where you can find more technical definitions.</p>

            <dt id="term-cbsa term-core-based-statistical-area">Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA)</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Officially specified by the Office of Management and Budget, the CBSA is the Census <a href="{% url 'glossary' %}#term-summary-level">summary level</a> representing a &ldquo;metropolitan area.&rdquo; Technically, CBSAs are either <a href="{% url 'glossary' %}#term-micropolitan-statistical-area">metropolitan</a> or <a href="{% url 'glossary' %}#term-micropolitan-statistical-area">micropolitan statistical areas</a>—both describe a specific group of counties (or sometimes just one county) around an urban core.</p>
                <p>While metro areas vary greatly in size, for some kinds of analysis they are better units of comparison than the single Census <a href="{% url 'glossary' %}#term-place">place</a> at the core.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt id="term-county-subdivision">County Subdivision</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>While the name is a bit generic, in some parts of the US, the county subdivision is the most appropriate <a href="{% url 'glossary' %}#term-summary-level">summary level</a> to use for statistical analysis. Specifically, in the New England states, New York, and Wisconsin, towns and boroughs are treated as county subdivisions. </p>
                <p>Especially in midwestern states, townships are a familiar geography which the Census organizes in the county subdivision summary level.</p>
                <p>For more, see the <a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_cousub.html">Census documentation on county subdivisions</a>.</p>

            <dt id="term-margin-of-error">Margin of Error</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>A number describing the statistical confidence in an estimate. When the margin of error is more than 10% of the estimate, Census Reporter recommends using caution when presenting the estimate. Know your wiggle-words.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt id="term-metropolitan-statistical-area">Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>A county or counties around an urban core of population greater than 50,000. See <a href="{% url 'glossary' %}#term-cbsa">Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA)</a> for more.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt id="term-micropolitan-statistical-area">Micropolitan Statistical Area (μSA)</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>A county or counties around an urban core of population between 10,000 and 50,000. See <a href="{% url 'glossary' %}#term-cbsa">Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA)</a> for more.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt id="term-place">Place</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>A Census <a href="{% url 'glossary' %}#term-summary-level">summary level</a> representing officially incorporated governments such as cities, towns, villages, and boroughs. Census &ldquo;places&rdquo; also include unincorporated areas which are identifiable by name: the Census Bureau calls these CDPs, or &ldquo;Census Designated Places.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>In some parts of the country (especially New England, New York, Wisconsin and Alaska), <a href="{% url 'glossary' %}#term-county-subdivision">county subdivisions</a> are a more appropriate unit of comparison than Census places.</p>
                <p>For more technical details, see the <a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_place.html">Census documentation on places</a>.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt id="term-summary-level">Summary Level</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>The Census Bureau tabulates data for many different geographic scales. Summary Level is the generic term for a kind of geography, such as state, county, or <a href="{% url 'glossary' %}#term-place">place</a>. There are also summary levels for somewhat esoteric tabulations, such as the parts of Census tracts which are divided between places.</p>
